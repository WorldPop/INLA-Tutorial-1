# INLA-Tutorial-1
Tomas Bird
Nov 9 2016

This repo has a self-contained tutorial that will help people understand how to build geostatistical analyses.  As well, it serves as an example of a Knitr document (though it doesn't do a great job of this part due to some code chunks that take a long time to compile).  
Known bugs include:  
1) some archaic methods for defining prediction coordinates
2) inclusion of a prediction location plot that results in a stupidly-large pdf
3) possible boundary issues in the outdated prediction methods.

Also serves as a good opportunity to allow people to fork and make changes via GIT.
